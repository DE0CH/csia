## Dear IB Examiner, 
Please see the (much better and more elegant than PDF) `docs/ib/ib_docs.md` markdown document for the write-up needed exclusively for the grades. 

## Development
I am still working on a development documentation. Depending on if people actually want to use it and whether I can find other developers to maintain and improve the project. For now, you can read the `docs/ib/ib_docs.md` to get a rough idea of the project. 

## Licence
All parts of the program EXCEPT the IB related documents under `docs/ib` are available under the [MIT License](https://de0ch.mit-license.org/).
